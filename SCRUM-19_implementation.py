Sure! Here is a sample Python code snippet that creates a simple dashboard using the popular `Dash` library in Python for XBRL functionality:

```python
import dash
from dash import html

app = dash.Dash(__name__)

app.layout = html.Div([
    html.H1('XBRL Dashboard'),
    html.P('Welcome to the XBRL functionality dashboard!'),
    # Add your XBRL functionality components here
])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run_server(debug=True)
```

You can then expand on this code snippet by adding specific XBRL functionality components such as tables, charts, or interactive elements to create a more comprehensive dashboard for XBRL functionality.
