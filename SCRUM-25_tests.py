   - Input: Valid CSV file with data
   - Expected output: JSON object containing the converted data from CSV file

2. Test case: Empty CSV file conversion
   - Input: Empty CSV file
   - Expected output: Empty JSON object

3. Test case: CSV file with special characters conversion
   - Input: CSV file with special characters in data
   - Expected output: JSON object containing the converted data with special characters

4. Test case: CSV file with multiple rows conversion
