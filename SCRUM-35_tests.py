Test Case 1:
- Description: Verify that the Python script can successfully monitor CPU usage and send an alert email when it exceeds a certain threshold.
- Input: CPU usage exceeds the threshold
- Expected Output: An alert email is sent to the specified email address.

Test Case 2:
- Description: Verify that the Python script can successfully monitor memory usage and send an alert email when it exceeds a certain threshold.
- Input: Memory usage exceeds the threshold
- Expected Output: An alert email is sent to the specified email address.

Test Case 3:
- Description: Verify that the Python script can successfully monitor disk usage and send an alert email when it exceeds a certain threshold.
- Input: Disk usage exceeds the threshold
- Expected Output: An alert email is sent to the specified email address.

Test Case 4:
- Description: Verify that the Python script can handle multiple resource monitoring and send alert emails for each resource that exceeds its threshold.
- Input: CPU, memory, and disk usage exceed their respective thresholds
- Expected Output: Alert emails are sent for each resource that exceeds its threshold.

Test Case 5:
- Description: Verify that the Python script can handle different threshold values for each resource and send alert emails accordingly.
- Input: CPU, memory, and disk usage exceed their individual thresholds
- Expected Output: Alert emails are sent for each resource that exceeds its specific threshold.
