Test cases for creating a database connection with Oracle DB:

1. Verify that the user can provide valid credentials (username, password) to establish a connection with the Oracle database.
2. Test that the system handles incorrect credentials gracefully and provides a relevant error message.
3. Ensure that the connection string format is correct and can successfully establish a connection with the Oracle database.
4. Test that the system can handle connection timeouts and retries the connection automatically.
5. Verify that the system can handle network interruptions during the connection process and reconnects seamlessly.
6. Test the performance of the connection by establishing multiple connections simultaneously and measure the response time.
7. Ensure that the system can handle concurrent connections from multiple users without any issues.
8. Test that the database connection is closed properly after the user logs out or the session expires.
9. Verify that the connection is secure and encrypted to protect sensitive data during transmission.
10. Test that the system logs connection activities for monitoring and troubleshooting purposes.
