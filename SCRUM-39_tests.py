Test Case 1:
- Description: Test if the Python script can successfully monitor CPU usage and send an alert email when it exceeds the specified threshold.
- Input: Simulate CPU usage exceeding the threshold value.
- Expected Output: Verify that the script detects the high CPU usage and sends an alert email.

Test Case 2:
- Description: Test if the Python script can successfully monitor memory usage and send an alert email when it exceeds the specified threshold.
- Input: Simulate memory usage exceeding the threshold value.
- Expected Output: Verify that the script detects the high memory usage and sends an alert email.

Test Case 3:
- Description: Test if the Python script can successfully monitor disk usage and send an alert email when it exceeds the specified threshold.
- Input: Simulate disk usage exceeding the threshold value.
- Expected Output: Verify that the script detects the high disk usage and sends an alert email.

Test Case 4:
- Description: Test if the Python script can handle multiple resource thresholds being exceeded simultaneously.
- Input: Simulate CPU, memory, and disk usage exceeding their respective threshold values.
- Expected Output: Verify that the script can detect multiple high resource usages and send an alert email for each.

Test Case 5:
- Description: Test if the Python script can send alert emails to multiple recipients.
- Input: Specify multiple email addresses to receive alert emails.
- Expected Output: Verify that the script sends alert emails to all specified recipients when resource thresholds are exceeded.
