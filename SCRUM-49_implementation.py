Sure! Here's a sample Python code that demonstrates how to generate a monthly report by pulling data from an SQLite database and creating charts using Matplotlib:

```python
import sqlite3
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Connect to the SQLite database
conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Query to pull data from the database
query = "SELECT date, revenue FROM monthly_data WHERE month = 'January'"
cursor.execute(query)
results = cursor.fetchall()

# Extracting data for plotting
dates = [result[0] for result in results]
revenue = [result[1] for result in results]

# Create a line chart using Matplotlib
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(dates, revenue, marker='o')
plt.title('Monthly Revenue Report - January')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Revenue')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()

# Close the database connection
conn.close()
```

In this script:
1. Replace `'your_database.db'` with the path to your SQLite database file.
2. Update the query to pull the relevant data for the monthly report.
3. Customize the chart title, labels, and styling as needed.

You can extend this script to generate reports for other months by changing the query and chart titles accordingly.
