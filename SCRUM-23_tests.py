Test case 1: 
Title: Verify successful connection to Oracle database using REST API
Description: Attempt to connect to an Oracle database from a webpage using REST API in Python and verify that the connection is successful.
Test steps:
1. Send a request to the REST API endpoint to establish a connection to the Oracle database.
2. Verify that the response status is successful (200 OK).
3. Check if the connection to the Oracle database is established.
Expected outcome: The connection to the Oracle database is successfully established.

Test case 2:
Title: Verify error handling for invalid Oracle database credentials
Description: Test the scenario where invalid credentials are provided when attempting to connect to an Oracle database using REST API.
Test steps:
1. Send a request to the REST API endpoint with invalid database credentials.
2. Verify that the response status is an error (e.g., 401 Unauthorized or 403 Forbidden).
3. Check if an appropriate error message is returned in the response.
Expected outcome: An error response is received indicating invalid credentials.

Test case 3:
Title: Verify timeout handling for Oracle database connection
Description: Test the scenario where the connection to the Oracle database exceeds the timeout limit.
Test steps:
1. Send a request to the REST API endpoint to establish a connection to the Oracle database with a very short timeout limit.
2. Wait for the timeout period to elapse.
3. Verify that the response status indicates a timeout error.
Expected outcome: A timeout error is received due to the connection exceeding the specified timeout limit.
