Sure! Here is a simple Python code snippet that generates a basic HTML template for the first website:

```python
# Create a new HTML file
with open('index.html', 'w') as file:
    file.write('''
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>My First Website</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Welcome to My First Website!</h1>
        <p>This is a simple HTML page created using Python.</p>
    </body>
    </html>
    ''')

print("HTML file created successfully!")
```

You can run this code in a Python environment to generate an `index.html` file with a basic HTML template for your first website. Feel free to customize the content and styling as needed.
