1. Test Case: Verify that the Python script can connect to the SQLite database successfully and pull data for the monthly report.
2. Test Case: Verify that the Python script can aggregate and process the data from the database to generate the monthly report.
3. Test Case: Verify that the Python script can create various types of charts (e.g., bar chart, line chart, pie chart) using matplotlib based on the data from the database.
4. Test Case: Verify that the generated charts are visually appealing and accurately represent the data from the database.
5. Test Case: Verify that the Python script can save the monthly report with the charts in a specific file format (e.g., PDF, PNG) for easy sharing and distribution.
6. Test Case: Verify that the monthly report includes all the necessary information and insights based on the data pulled from the database.
7. Test Case: Verify that the Python script handles errors gracefully, such as database connection issues or missing data, and provides appropriate error messages.
8. Test Case: Verify that the Python script runs efficiently and does not consume excessive system resources while generating the monthly report and charts.
9. Test Case: Verify that the Python script follows best practices for code readability, maintainability, and scalability to ensure future updates and enhancements can be easily implemented.
10. Test Case: Verify that the Python script can be scheduled to run automatically on a monthly basis to generate the report without manual intervention.
